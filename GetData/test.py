def detect_regressions(steps, threshold=0, min_size=2):
    
    # 这段代码的功能是检测信号中的回归，即检测信号中的上升段。它会返回最新值、最佳值以及回归位置之间的信息。参数steps是一个元组的列表，每个元组包含左右的值，值，最小值和误差，阈值用于过滤小跳跃，而min_size用于指定最小的回归大小。
    """Detect regressions in a (noisy) signal.
    A regression means an upward step in the signal.  The value
    'before' a regression is the value immediately preceding the
    upward step.  The value 'after' a regression is the minimum of
    values after the upward step.
    Parameters
    ----------
    steps : list of (left, right, value, min, error)
        List of steps computed by detect_steps, or equivalent
    threshold : float
        Relative threshold for reporting regressions. Filter out jumps
        whose relative size is smaller than threshold, if they are not
        necessary to explain the difference between the best and the latest
        values.
    min_size : int
        Minimum number of commits in a regression to consider it.
    Returns
    -------
    latest_value
        Latest value
    best_value
        Best value
    regression_pos : list of (before, after, value_before, best_value_after)
        List of positions between which the value increased. The first item
        corresponds to the last position at which the best value was obtained.
        The last item indicates the best value found after the regression
        (which is not always the value immediately following the regression).
